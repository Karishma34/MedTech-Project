"Thank you for sharing this, Luisa. Your openness reminds us we're not alone in our mental health struggles. And talking about the different medication you tried and how you experimented with them may easily help others find treatments that could greatly improve their lives.",anti-depressants
"Inspiring to see someone taking such an organised, systematic approach to their health. Inspiring also to see someone sharing their mental health struggles openly and in a constructive way.",anti-depressants
"I feel like I can't draw many conclusions from this data because of the big risk of confounding factors (maybe an external event happened while you were on one medication and not when on another), because drugs tend to work quite differently in different people, because N=1 and because there didn't appear to be blinding.",anti-depressants
"Anectodal evidence has its place, though. Please keep up the good work.",anti-depressants
"I strongly upvoted this comment because I think your middle paragraph is a true and necessary thing to say, and phrased in a fairly kind way (where many nearby phrasings may be substantially less kind). Given the clear cognitive distortions people may have around this and adjacent topics, being reminded of ""obvious facts"" can still be helpful.",anti-depressants
"Thanks for writing this, great to hear that you're feeling better.",anti-depressants
"I'm usually a fan of self-experimentation, and the upside of finding an antidepressant with few side-effects (and that you can take a lower dose of) is definitely valuable. This seems especially true if you can stop taking it during better mental health periods, then have it in your arsenal for future use. But I still have a few doubts about this process, and I'm a little concerned that some of the premises behind your experiment need a bit more scrutiny. I hope someone with a bit more domain-specific knowledge can correct me if I'm wrong, or improve my arguments if I have a point. I'm also aware that there's no such thing as a 'perfect self-experiment', and I don't think there are obvious ways that you could have improved the experiment. But here are a few things that I'd like to hear your  thoughts on:",anti-depressants
"Firstly, the depression episode was triggered by an disruptive external factor- the pandemic. This would probably invalidate any observational study held in the same period. As this external factor improved, and people could start travelling/ socialising normally, you might expect symptoms to lift naturally from mid-2021 onwards. From what you've mentioned here, you don't seem to have disproved this hypothesis. I gather that depressive episodes seem to last a median of about 6 months ( see pic below), with treatment not making a huge difference for duration within the first year (some obvious caveats about selection effects here). How do you consider the possibility that you would have recovered without antidepressants?",anti-depressants
"Secondly, the process of switching between 5/6 antidepressants seems to be a significant confounding factor here. I don't know how good the evidence base for the guidelines link you sent was, but it seems likely that the multiple (start, side-effects, ending, potential relapse) effects of antidepressants  are significant enough to really mess up any attempts to have a 'clean slate' between treatments, and to therefore make it a unfair comparison. It seems possible that what you thought was a negative reaction to x medicine was actually contingent on having just tapered off y medicine and/ or experiencing a relapse. Does that seem plausible, or do you think that there was a stable enough baseline for comparisons to be valid?",anti-depressants
"Third, just a bit of concern about the downsides of the experiment. There are some long-term side-effects to antidepressants, and they seem understudied for fairly obvious reasons (most clinical studies only last for 6 months, no long-term RCTs). There seems to be a few studies that point to longer-term risks and 'oppositional effects' being underestimated. Unknown confounding factors and additional health risks from going on and off antidepressants would make me very concerned. Obviously, untreated depression also has a range of health risks, so I don't want to discount the other side of the ledger, but I would definitely not be confident that I was doing something safe. How confident do you feel in your comparison of these risks? And did you feel that you had to convince yourself against (potentially irrational) fear of over-medication?",anti-depressants
"Finally, a bit unrelated, there's a meta question that often comes to mind when I read posts about more rational/ self-experimenting approaches to health issues, which is: ""How strong should our naturalistic bias/heuristic be when approaching mental health/ general health issues?"" Particularly for my own health, I have a moderate bias against less 'natural' (obviously a very messy term, but I think it's useful) health solutions. I often feel EAs have the opposite bias, preferring pharmacological solutions, perhaps because they can be tested with a nice clean RCT. I'm interested what level of bias you, (and forum readers), think is optimal. ",anti-depressants
"As a GP myself, I would love patients like you who are evidence based and committed to treatment plans!",anti-depressants
It is well understood depression and other mood disorders are very complex and multimodal. So trying a bunch of stuff outside medication also useful.,anti-depressants
Also worth mentioning there is A LOT or epigenetic factors we don't understand well and can make a big difference on effects and side effects of medications. Trial and error is usually indicated like you have done in refractory and treatment resistance experience like yours.,anti-depressants
"Well done on sharing too. Mental health is like any other chronic disease, and important to aim for 'well managed' rather than 'cure' ... Because we all get down from time to time!",anti-depressants
"What Stephen said ❤️ And CONGRATS ON PERSEVERING 💪 And while I'm here, big shout-out to your partner, therapist, friends, colleagues, and especially to Rob (I was actually thinking of thanking him earlier today - I am loving bupropion right now) 🙌",anti-depressants
"In head-to-head studies, agomelatine, amitriptyline, escitalopram, mirtazapine, paroxetine, venlafaxine, and vortioxetine were more effective than other antidepressants (range of ORs [odds ratios] 1·19–1·96)",anti-depressants
"I think you've missed out bupropion - OR of ~1.65 according to Figure B? (Also, all the ones you list here seem to have ORs more specifically in the range ~1.45-1.96 according to Figure B?)",anti-depressants
"Good to see that your post isn't perfect, but I thought I'd point it out 😉",anti-depressants
"Strong upvoted, I found this very interesting and I expect that quite a few people will find it helpful. ",anti-depressants
"I don't know if it's been posted here before, but Scott Alexander has a detailed writeup on depression treatment that people may also find useful, including information on the order he often has his patients try medications in. ",anti-depressants
Highlights from the linked writeup:,anti-depressants
Most patients will want either escitalopram or bupropion as first-line treatment. These medications are easy to use and have fewer side effects than most others.,anti-depressants
"[V]ortioxetine [is] very expensive without having obvious advantages over much cheaper drugs, and I can rarely find a use for [it].",anti-depressants
"Speaking as a vortioxetine user, the main advantage for me is that it has a quite different side effect profile from other antidepressants of similar effect size and ""risk level"" -- one which I personally prefer to SSRIs, bupropion, or mirtazapine.",anti-depressants
"Seems like esketamine with ""some effect in a day"", a comparative lack of side effects, and lack of withdrawal issues might be an attractive option. I am curious why wasn't it on your list?",anti-depressants
"Thank you so much for writing this up, Luisa!  It has lots of good data and advice.",anti-depressants
"A quick thought based on what helped me when I was burning out: I'd consider working part-time for a while to see if reduced work stress helps. Work is often a massive source of stress and sometimes we need extended downtime (e.g., not just a weekend) to make progress on recovering from the damage of our past stresses. Working part-time can also give you alot of time for self-care, therapy, changing habits and so on. Eitherway, I wish you the best of luck in the future!",anti-depressants
I'd be interested to hear more about how  you measured effectiveness.,anti-depressants
If I understand correctly it takes several weeks to taper on and taper off most antidepressants.,anti-depressants
Were you operating from a baseline where your depressive symptoms were fairly consistent for many months?,anti-depressants
"If not, how did you guage effectiveness vs placebo?",anti-depressants
"Perhaps you approached these tests as mostly about finding one that didn't have acute side-effects, and also wasn't obviously not working?",anti-depressants
"Perhaps you approached these tests as mostly about finding one that didn't have acute side-effects, and also wasn't obviously not working?",anti-depressants
"Yea, I basically did this ^^ It was just extremely obvious to me when something was working/wasn't, and the fact that many antidepressants I was super optimistic about didn't work makes me think I wasn't getting huge placebo issues. While self-reported data is obviously a bit tricky, my sense of whether something was/wasn't working was backed up by the data I collected. ",anti-depressants
"Note that people in US/UK and presumably other places can buy drugs on the grey market (e.g. here) for less than standard prices. Although I wouldn't trust these 100%, they should be fairly safe because they're certified in other countries like India; gwern wrote about this here for modafinil and the basic analysis seems to hold for many antidepressants. The shipping times advertised are fairly long but potentially still less hassle than waiting for a doctor's appointment for each one.",anti-depressants
"Do you know of anything equivalent for stimulants? They don't seem to have that category, and it's more tightly regulated, so I don't expect a positive response here, but I ask jic. I'm worried that a future dr might not renew my 3-month prescription for whatever reason, and then I'm in shambles.",anti-depressants
"Yeah, I don't think it's possible for controlled substances due to the tighter regulation.",anti-depressants
Edit (Cutting out a lot in response to Charles' comments):  ,anti-depressants
"Vyvance, Adderall, and coffee can each improve mood. I'll leave it at that.",anti-depressants
"Ok there's been a couple comments on ""don't go to your doctor"", ""drug hack"".",anti-depressants
My two cents: Vyvance / Adderall is worth a try for depression... [Low side effects. Thankfully it's completely in and out of your system in 24 hours.],anti-depressants
Perpetuating the illusion that mental health professionals usually know what they're doing can be harmfwl,anti-depressants
"Basically, I'm pretty sure this is wrong/dangerous.",anti-depressants
"Lisdexamfetamine is indeed being explored to treat depression, and some anti depressants like buproprion have a very stimulant sort of flavor.  ",anti-depressants
"But applying these theories directly as a sign of to take stimulants is very very simplistic. Also, there's a clownish level of abuse of medications in US/western society (see opoids). ",anti-depressants
"To be gearsy, one issue is that stimulants bring you up, but then you almost always have a crash or a low phase—it's easy to see how this low phase could be very very bad for some people. These substances also have relationships with other disorders/issues that are complicated. Also, these side effects definitely aren't ""limited to being in out of your system in 24 hours"". ",anti-depressants
"I don't have a long list of references for this or time to provide this, but you can google to explore the standard issues and side effects the stimulant drugs:",anti-depressants
Just don't tell your doctor that's what you want it for,anti-depressants
"especially in this crowd, because most people here can do better by trusting their own cursory research.",anti-depressants
"RE: This and other ""anti doctor stuff"". ",anti-depressants
"There's a lot to write here, but ultimately, these comments and stuff shouldn't be on a major internet forum, definitely not the EA forum. ",anti-depressants
The following gives one pretty good argument:,anti-depressants
"So the above sort of is a logical case that explains why internet forum for ""drug hacking"" (especially for mood/stimulants/depression) is bad.",anti-depressants
"This is more complicated (someone I know has a relationship with doctors where they sort of punch through and get whatever script they want, which is exactly in spirit of the above comment; doctors, psychologists are very mixed in quality; being an outlier makes all of this worse).  ",anti-depressants
"It's good to acknowledge the facts above—but unfortunately properly situating this all, without causing an ""EA forum style"" cascade that sort of makes it worse, is hard, in addition to time, it's sort of, ""I don't have enough crayons"" or ""I can't count that low"" sort of flavor.",anti-depressants
I agree with much of what you said and so edited my post. I do have a few points to make in the abstract though.,anti-depressants
"Although patients are prone to make mistakes such as abusing drugs, the medical establishment is sometimes majorly wrong in predictable ways, and waiting for the establishment to fix itself through the official channels can take sometimes decades. If caffeine was just discovered today, I think it would be classified as a controlled substance and restricted to certain diagnoses. (No?) If so, I think that would be a huge loss for humankind. ",anti-depressants
"The philosophy of clinical psychology/psychiatry as represented in the DSM strikes me as seriously flawed. They group things into discrete categories called ""disorders"" and eschew continuity and multidimensionality. As math (and its offshoots) becomes more wildly known, I think this will change, but it will take time. [I'm not saying that the concept of a disorder or diagnosis should be completely abandoned, but it has limitations]. ",anti-depressants
"Finally, the opioid comparison strikes me as strained. ",anti-depressants
"I appreciate the thoughtful consideration and I agree with you. IMO I think you are right, including  your points like the medical establishment is often wrong and slow. I'm less certain, but it's possible the DSM (and maybe a lot of physiatry) is a mess.",anti-depressants
"Finally, the opioid comparison strikes me as strained.",anti-depressants
"Yes, this should be deleted. Maybe I was trying to gesture at creating subcultures that normalize drug use inappropriately, and I was using ""opioid"" as an example in support of this, but this might be wrong and, if anything, supports your points equally or better. ",anti-depressants
The main difference is my concern about EA having subpopulations/subcultures with different resources. ,anti-depressants
"I support the OP, but I'm worried she's an outlier, being in a place where there is a huge amount of support, creating agency for her exploration (read the 80,000 hours CEO's story here).",anti-depressants
"I don't want to minimizing her journey, such personal work and progress should be encouraged and written up more, because it's great!",anti-depressants
"But, partially because this is impractical for many, I'm worried that something will get lost in translation, or some bad views might piggy back on this e.g. normalizing low-fidelity beliefs about drug use (that are Schedule II stimulants!).",anti-depressants
"Thanks for sharing this- it's very inspiring but also difficult to read because it's not realistic for many people struggling with mental health issues.It really captures why we (I'm speaking of Canada but I'm sure this applies to many other places) have a mental health crisis. It takes years to see a psychiatrist unless you get yourself checked into the hospital and then risk being admitted to a mental health facility against your will (which is scary to say the least). To actually have a psychiatrist support you through a process like this, as well as family members and your workplace, would almost never happen here. ",anti-depressants
"Thanks for writing this up, and sorry to hear you had to suffer through this Luisa!",anti-depressants
Some things I recently learned about antidepressants:,anti-depressants
"To limit withdrawal effects, hyperbolic tapering (reducing by x% per week) > slow tapering (reducing by fixed amount over months) > fast tapering (fixed amount over 2-4weeks) > cold turkey. https://www.madinamerica.com/2019/03/slow-tapering-best-antidepressant-withdrawal/
In addition, there's cross-tapering (introducing a new SSRI while tapering off an old one) that's supposedly helpful.",anti-depressants
"Some people become permanently disabled from (stopping) antidepressants. It ranges from sexual dysfunction to 9/10 severity and not being able to work. The risk seems to increase with duration of taking it. I don't know how many people experience this, but it was enough to create an All-Party Parliamentary Group in the UK for it (http://prescribeddrug.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/APPG-PDD-Survey-of-antidepressant-withdrawal-experiences.pdf). This implies a risk of 1 in 1,000 to 1 in 10,000 or something? It definitely makes me wary to recommend antidepressants to anyone, especially for an indefinite period of time.",anti-depressants
"(Note: the survey linked above has a very strong selection bias, so we can't glean much from the actual numbers besides the fact that the phenomenon exists)",anti-depressants
"This doesn't add much, but thank you for sharing this. I honestly believe that the world would be much better (and many people on this forum much happier) if more people did this. ",anti-depressants
"Thanks for posting this, Luisa!Depression is a beast that can affect anyone. While I have been lucky enough to evade it, I know plenty of others who suffer from it.It's really cool that you kept such detailed logs of your mood, wellbeing, and side effects! Your analysis is very thorough. I hadn't heard of ""brain zaps"" before! This information will no doubt be useful to others.I truly wish you the best on your journey toward fulfilment and happiness!",anti-depressants
"I'm curious how you choose the order to try the drugs in. Vortioxetine is such a positive outlier on the ""effectiveness and acceptability"" chart that when I saw that I assumed you would have tried it first, or at least early/soon, but instead it was the sixth you tried. Is there some generally-applicable reason why it'd be wiser to start with the other five first?(Note: My intuition that it made sense to start with vortioxetine based on the chart info was definitely strengthened when I saw that it's the drug you decided to stick with, but in reality I probably shouldn't update much at all based on your one case about which drugs it'd make sense to start with.)",anti-depressants
"Yea, good question. It's basically because I started with NHS psychiatrists (who strongly prefer to prescribe SSRIs), and only later moved to a private psychiatrist (who recommended I start first with agomelatine because of the excellent side effect profile, given that side effects were my main complaint).",anti-depressants
I tracked my mood and thought patterns in a few different ways:,anti-depressants
Funny how the antidepressant which ended up working for you is way higher than the others in your second figure. I'm wondering why you didn't start with this one: the smaller sample size? Also wondering how much I should update from the fact that it ended up being the best one for you.,anti-depressants
I am very sceptical that there is a lot you can do about depression. This post explains why. ,anti-depressants
"The time, effort and money spent in addition to the side effects of anti-depressants make me strongly doubt that treatment attempts are worth it.",anti-depressants
